# Model-Based Testing Prototype for TiGL

## Project Overview

Welcome to our model-based testing prototype for TiGL! This project was developed as part of the Software Quality course (Project 9). The goal is to create a model-based testing approach for TiGL, a Titanium Graphical Library commonly used in the aerospace industry for aircraft wing design. This repository contains test cases and automation scripts for testing the TiGL Viewer's graphical user interface (GUI) using Model-Based Testing (MBT) and the GraphWalker tool.

## Features

- **Model-Based Testing (MBT):**
  - Formulate test cases based on the expected behavior of the TiGL Viewer's GUI.
  - Ensure comprehensive coverage of GUI interactions through structured test cases.

- **GraphWalker Automation:**
  - Utilize the GraphWalker tool for automating the execution of formulated test cases.
  - Benefit from the ability to visualize and analyze test coverage with GraphWalker.

- **AppleScript/Automator Automation:**
  - Utilize the Apple Automator tool for automating the execution of formulated test cases.
