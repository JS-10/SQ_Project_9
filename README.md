# Model-Based Testing Prototype for TiGL

## Project Overview

Welcome to our model-based testing prototype for TiGL! This project was developed as part of the Software Quality course (Project 9). The goal is to create a model-based testing approach for TiGL, a Titanium Graphical Library commonly used in the aerospace industry for aircraft wing design.

## Features

- **Parametric Modeling:** Explore various wing configurations by defining parameters such as span, sweep, and dihedral angles.
- **Geometry Generation:** Generate 3D wing surfaces based on user-defined parameters.
- **Aerodynamic Analysis:** Evaluate aerodynamic performance by analyzing lift, drag, and other key factors.
- **Structural Analysis:** Assess the structural integrity of wing designs through analysis tools.
- **Mesh Generation:** Create computational meshes for finite element analysis.
